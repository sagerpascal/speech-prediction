# Temporal Speech Context
This is the documentation of the repository [https://github.com/sagerpascal/temporal-speech-context](https://github.com/sagerpascal/temporal-speech-context).
It was created by [Pascal Sager](https://sagerpascal.github.io) as his first project thesis. Goal of the thesis:

> "Train a NN to predict a frame of speech (MFCC) from its predecessor; better: how many frames into the future we could predict from one frame? A word (=Science paper)? Also both directions (predict previous AND next frame). Could be done with a transformer trained in the same way current NLP models are trained."
