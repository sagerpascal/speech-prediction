## Importance of Temporal Information
- [Rosen "Temporal information in speech: acoustic, auditory and linguistic aspects"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/55906?seq=1)
  - The author shows that the temporal properties play an important role in linguistic and that speech is based in three main temporal features: Envelope, periodicity and fine-strcture

## Temporal Features in ASR using Gabor Filters
- [Lei et. al "SPECTRO-TEMPORAL GABOR FEATURES FOR SPEAKER RECOGNITION".](http://medi.uni-oldenburg.de/members/bernd/papers/ICASSP_2012_Lei.pdf)
  - The authors show that for a noisy dataset the "Gabor features performed as well as the MFCC features standalone, and score-level combination of Gabor and MFCC features resulted in an 8% relative EER improvement over MFCC features standalone"
- [Myer et. al "Comparing Different Flavors of Spectro-Temporal Features for ASR".](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/archive_papers/interspeech_2011/i11_1269.pdf)
  - The authors analyze s important design parameters for spectro-temporal features based on a Gabor filter bank. They obtained the best results using MLP-processed phase sensitive filters and added MFCCs, with relative error reductions of over 40% for both noisy and clean training.

## Network Architecture

- [Touvron et. al "Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention". ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877)
